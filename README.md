# The-capstone-project-of-IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate-Specialization

# As a part of my IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Specialization I must do 
# a capstone project showing as many as possible skills learned during the specialization passing. 
# The only condition that I had to meet when preparing a project is to use the FourSquare Api to solve a business problem, 
# which I had to define by myself. So, I think it would be nice to get an understanding on whether infrastructure, 
# enterprises, services located in a neighborhood relate with the end price in real estate-market. 
# And if some relation exists whether we can predict consumer price of a flat basing only on what places are around.

# To see the full project with the code please see the Jupyter notebook
